# philosopher-vs-machine

One Friday evening with endless hours of scrolling, gave us this
idea to play around with AI and create this book out of thin
air . We found it a good learning opportunity for how these AI
work and to understand how capable they are. Alongside this,
we wanted to get in touch with our artistic and philosophical
side, which let us create this book. An initial conversation with
chatGPT intrigued us and we wanted to put it to the test and
push its limits both of capabilities, composition articulation,
imagination and logic.
